- Use Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling, with custom CSS only for special cases  
- Organize classes logically (layout, spacing, color, typography)  
- Use responsive and state variants (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:, hover:, focus:, dark:) in markup  
- Embrace Tailwind v4 features like container queries and CSS variables  
- Rely on Tailwind classes rather than inline styles or external CSS files for a unified design language
