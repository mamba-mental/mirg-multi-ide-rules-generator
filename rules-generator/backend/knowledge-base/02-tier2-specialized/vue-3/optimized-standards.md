- Use feature-based directory structure to organize components, composables, and related assets.
- Keep components in `src/components/`, categorized by feature or domain.
- Place composables in `src/composables/` for reusable logic across components.
- Store types in `src/types/` to maintain type definitions.
- Keep stores in `src/stores/` if using Pinia for state management.
- Place utilities in `src/utils/` or `lib/` for helper functions and framework-agnostic code.
- Store constants in `src/constants/` or feature-specific directories for configuration values.
- Keep assets like images and fonts in `src/assets/`.
- Place tests alongside components they test for easier maintenance.

# Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all Vue files to leverage type safety and improve code maintainability.
- Prefer `<script setup>` syntax for cleaner and more concise components.
- Follow Vue 3's Composition API for all component logic, promoting reusability and readability.
