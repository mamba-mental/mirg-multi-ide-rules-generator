You are an expert in Angular 19 and TypeScript. You are focusing on producing clear, readable code. You always use the latest stable versions of Angular 19 and you are familiar with the latest features and best practices.

### Project Structure
- Always define new components as standalone components to simplify dependency management and enhance reusability across the application.
- Organize project files into separate folders for components, services, and utilities to maintain a clear and scalable structure.
- Use kebab-case for file names and PascalCase for component class names to ensure naming consistency throughout the project.

### Code Style
- Prefer Signals for reactive state management to take advantage of Angular 19's efficient and fine-grained reactivity model.
- Utilize TypeScript 5.6 features like iterator helper methods and strict type checking to enhance code safety and developer productivity.
- Write clean, well-documented code with meaningful variable names and concise functions to improve readability and maintainability.

### Usage
- Use the Angular CLI for generating components, services, and managing updates to keep the project aligned with Angular 19 standards.
- Implement lazy loading for feature modules and components using loadChildren in routes to optimize initial load times and application performance.
- Write unit tests for all components and services using Jasmine and Karma to ensure code reliability and robustness.

### Performance Optimization
- Use standalone components with on-demand rendering to reduce initial load times and improve the user experience in large applications.
- Leverage Angular’s router preloading strategies to efficiently load critical modules in the background without impacting performance.
- Apply the OnPush change detection strategy in components where possible to minimize unnecessary change detection cycles.

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Always include type annotations for variables, parameters, and return types to enforce strict typing and catch errors early.
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for defining object shapes to support better extensibility and declaration merging in TypeScript.
- Avoid using the any type; instead, define specific types or use generics to maintain strong type safety throughout the codebase.

### General Angular 19 Coding Standards
- Use dependency injection consistently for services to promote modularity and testability across the application.
- Prefer reactive forms over template-driven forms for complex form handling to leverage Angular’s robust form control and validation features.
- Implement error handling in services and components using try-catch blocks and Angular’s ErrorHandler to manage runtime issues gracefully.

### Component Design
- Keep components small and focused by extracting reusable logic into directives or pipes to enhance maintainability and reusability.
- Use input and output decorators with type safety to define clear component contracts and ensure predictable data flow.
- Avoid direct DOM manipulation; instead, rely on Angular’s templating and data-binding mechanisms for consistency and performance.

### State Management
- Combine Signals with RxJS observables where appropriate, using Signals for local component state and observables for asynchronous data streams.
- Centralize application-wide state in services or state management libraries like NgRx when Signals alone are insufficient for complex scenarios.
- Use immutable data patterns when updating state to ensure predictable change detection and avoid side effects.

### Routing and Navigation
- Define route guards (e.g., CanActivate, CanDeactivate) to secure routes and manage navigation logic effectively.
- Use resolver services to prefetch data before route activation to improve user experience and reduce flickering.
- Leverage router events to track navigation lifecycle and implement analytics or loading indicators as needed.

### Template Best Practices
- Use Angular’s built-in structural directives like ngIf and ngFor with proper trackBy functions to optimize rendering performance.
- Prefer async pipe for subscribing to observables in templates to avoid manual subscription management and memory leaks.
- Keep templates declarative and logic-free, moving complex logic into components or services for better separation of concerns.

### Interoperability and Integration
- Use Angular’s custom elements feature to create reusable web components for integration with non-Angular applications.
- Leverage Angular Universal for server-side rendering (SSR) to improve SEO and initial load performance for public-facing apps.
- Integrate Angular Material or other Angular-specific libraries for consistent UI components, ensuring they support Angular 19 features like standalone components.
