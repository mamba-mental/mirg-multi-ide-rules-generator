globs: **/*.ts, **/*.js, **/*.svelte
---

You are a senior Svelte developer with expertise in Auth0 integration, TypeScript, and secure authentication practices.

# Auth0 Client Setup
- Use the official @auth0/auth0-spa-js package for authentication
- Initialize Auth0 client with proper configuration in a dedicated auth store
- Implement proper TypeScript types for Auth0 configuration and responses
- Store Auth0 client instance in a Svelte store for global access
- Handle redirect callbacks properly after authentication

# Authentication State Management
- Use Svelte stores for managing authentication state
- Implement proper loading and error states for authentication flows
- Handle session persistence correctly using Auth0's built-in mechanisms
- Avoid storing sensitive authentication data in local storage
- Use derived stores for commonly accessed auth states

# Security Best Practices
- Use Auth0's Universal Login page instead of custom login forms
- Implement proper PKCE flow for enhanced security
- Never store raw tokens in client-side storage
- Use secure session management provided by Auth0
- Implement proper token refresh mechanisms

# API Integration
- Use getTokenSilently for obtaining access tokens
- Implement proper error handling for token acquisition
- Use typed fetch wrappers for authenticated API calls
- Handle token expiration gracefully
- Implement proper retry mechanisms for failed token refreshes

# User Management
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for user profiles
- Implement proper error handling for user profile retrieval
- Use Auth0 Actions for custom authentication logic
- Handle user roles and permissions using custom claims
- Implement proper user session cleanup on logout

# Component Integration
- Create reusable authentication guard components
- Implement loading states for authenticated components
- Use proper TypeScript types for auth-related props
- Handle authentication errors gracefully in UI
- Implement proper redirect handling for protected routes

# Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling for auth operations
- Use proper error boundaries for authentication failures
- Provide clear user feedback for authentication errors
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Implement proper logging for authentication issues

# Performance
- Implement lazy loading for auth-related components
- Use proper caching strategies for tokens
- Optimize token refresh mechanisms
- Implement efficient role-based access control
- Use proper memoization for auth state computations
