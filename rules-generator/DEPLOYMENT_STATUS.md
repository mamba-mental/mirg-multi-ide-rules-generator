# MIRG Portainer Deployment Status

## Deployment Analysis Complete ✅

### Pre-deployment Checks
- ✅ Portainer accessible at http://192.168.86.97:9000
- ✅ All required files present and validated
- ✅ Port conflict resolution completed (moved Weaviate to 8093)
- ✅ Docker Compose configuration optimized
- ✅ Custom Dockerfiles validated for Portainer compatibility

### Port Allocation
- **Frontend**: 3011 → Available ✅
- **Backend**: 3121 → Available ✅  
- **Weaviate**: 8093 → Available ✅ (changed from 8092 due to conflict)

### Key Deployment Fixes Applied
1. **Custom Dockerfiles**: Eliminated sudo/su dependencies
2. **Permission Management**: Proper file permissions set at build time  
3. **Volume Strategy**: Named volumes for node_modules to prevent permission issues
4. **Security**: Read-only source mounts for development
5. **Alpine Containers**: Pre-installed necessary utilities

### Deployment Method
**Manual deployment via Portainer Web UI is recommended** due to authentication requirements.

## Manual Deployment Steps

1. **Open Portainer**: Navigate to http://192.168.86.97:9000
2. **Create Stack**: Go to Stacks → Add Stack
3. **Stack Name**: `mirg`
4. **Compose Content**: Use `docker-compose.portainer-fixed.yml`
5. **Deploy**: Click "Deploy the stack"

### Expected Service URLs After Deployment
- **Frontend**: http://192.168.86.97:3011
- **Backend API**: http://192.168.86.97:3121
- **Weaviate**: http://192.168.86.97:8093

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check Weaviate health
curl http://192.168.86.97:8093/v1/.well-known/ready

# Check Backend health (may take 2-3 minutes to fully start)
curl http://192.168.86.97:3121/health

# Check Frontend
curl -s http://192.168.86.97:3011 | head -5
```

## Deployment Files Ready
- ✅ `docker-compose.portainer-fixed.yml` - Main deployment configuration
- ✅ `backend/Dockerfile.portainer` - Custom backend container
- ✅ `frontend/Dockerfile.portainer` - Custom frontend container  
- ✅ `simple-deploy.sh` - Deployment guide script
- ✅ `deploy-portainer-api.py` - Automated deployment (requires auth)

## Next Steps

**Proceed with manual deployment using Portainer web interface** - all prerequisites are met and configuration is optimized for successful deployment.

The deployment is ready to execute with high confidence of success based on comprehensive analysis and port conflict resolution.
