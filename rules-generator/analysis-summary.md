- **Context-Aware Selection**: Rules are selected based on IDE, project type, and token budget
- **Automated Processing**: Large documents are automatically chunked and processed

#### Modern Architecture Patterns
- **Event-Driven Design**: Both modules use event patterns for loose coupling
- **Microservice Architecture**: Clear separation between frontend and backend concerns
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible through adapters and configuration

#### Robust Data Management
- **Vector Database**: Weaviate provides scalable semantic search capabilities
- **Cryptographic Verification**: Evidence integrity is maintained through hashing
- **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All operations are logged for compliance requirements

### 3. Integration Points

#### Direct Integrations
- **MIRG Runtime Monitor**: Security events are automatically mapped to compliance controls
- **Filesystem Contracts**: Abstracted storage layer for different backend implementations
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line access to compliance operations

#### Potential Integration Opportunities
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated compliance checks during build processes
- **Monitoring Systems**: Integration with Prometheus, Grafana, etc.
- **Ticketing Systems**: Automatic creation of tickets for compliance findings
