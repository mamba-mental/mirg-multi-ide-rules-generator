# Rules Generator & Enterprise Compliance Architecture Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the rules-generator and enterprise-compliance (filesystem-contracts) modules. The analysis reveals a sophisticated system designed to generate development rules packages and integrate with enterprise compliance frameworks, with a focus on AI-powered semantic search and runtime security monitoring.

## Module Overview

### 1. Rules Generator Module

The rules-generator module consists of a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend that creates customized development rules packages for different IDEs and project types.

#### Frontend Architecture (`rules-generator/frontend/`)

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation

**Key Components:**
- `App.tsx`: Main application component with routing
- `SinglePageConfig.tsx`: Configuration interface for rule generation
- `ConfigStore.ts`: Zustand store for state management
- Modern UI with responsive design and dark mode support

**Features:**
- IDE selection (Cursor, Cline, Claude, Roo)
- Project type selection (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Token budget configuration
- Framework-specific rule selection
- Real-time configuration preview

#### Backend Architecture (`rules-generator/backend/`)

**Technology Stack:**
- Express.js with TypeScript
- Weaviate vector database
- LangChain for semantic search
- OpenAI embeddings
- Archiver for ZIP file generation

**Key Components:**
- `index.ts`: Server initialization with health checks
- `routes/rules.ts`: API endpoints for rules management
- `controllers/rulesController.ts`: Business logic for rule generation
- `services/weaviate.ts`: Vector database integration

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/rules/generate`: Generate rules package
- `POST /api/rules/load-knowledge-base`: Load rules into vector store
- `POST /api/rules/search`: Semantic search of rules
- `GET /api/rules/health`: Health check

**Core Functionality:**
1. **Intelligent Rule Selection**: Uses semantic search to select relevant rules based on IDE, project type, and token budget
2. **Vector Database Integration**: Weaviate stores embedded rule documents for efficient retrieval
3. **Document Chunking**: Large documents are split into manageable chunks for processing
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when vector store is unavailable
5. **Package Generation**: Creates organized ZIP packages with README and usage instructions

### 3. Modular Design

Both systems follow modular design principles:
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data access
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extensible through adapters and integrations
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled through configuration objects

## Data Flow Architecture
